Hey all, wanted to share a working prototype of a Bluesky opt-in badge system.

I'm Gaf and I built a lightweight community labeler that lets users assign themselves fun, verified-style badges like 🍕 NYC Pizza or 🛡 Gaf Knows Me! — all through a simple web form.

It uses a flat labels.json backend, stores no personal data, and resolves my DID properly for future compatibility. When Bluesky opens up public labelers, this setup will be fully ready to plug in.

💻 Try it live: https://verify.gaf.nyc

🛠️ Built with @atproto standards, a static frontend, and a hosted JSON file. Deployed on Vercel, styled with love, and verified by vibes.

Would love feedback, or to help others get started building creative labelers, opt-in roles, or moderation tools.

Love,
Gaf

🤖 By the way, I built this with help from ChatGPT. AI assisted, human directed.
Concept, UX, and structure are all mine. The robot just helped carry the groceries.
